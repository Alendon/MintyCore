# MintyCore

MintyCore is a work-in-progress game engine/framework written in pure C#, primarily for a hobby project game called Techardry. It is designed to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS (though MacOS testing is pending). The engine itself provides minimal content and serves as a base framework for developers to build upon.

## Features

- Entity Component System
- Integrated Multiplayer with a Client-Server architecture
- Integrated Modding
- Vulkan-based rendering
- High Modularity

The goal of MintyCore is to deliver high performance while maintaining ease of use. This is facilitated by the use of source generation and custom Roslyn analyzers, which help to reduce boilerplate code, introduce more type safety and reduce the need for generic arguments.
